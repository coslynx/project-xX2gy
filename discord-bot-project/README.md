- Add a feature to display lyrics of the currently playing song.
- Incorporate a feature to create custom playlists and save them for future use.
- Integrate with music recommendation services to suggest songs based on user preferences.
- Implement a feature to show what song is currently playing in the Discord status.

## Programming Languages:
- Node.js will be used for the backend development of the Discord bot.
- JavaScript will be used for writing the bot's commands and functionality.

## APIs:
- Discord.js API will be integrated to interact with the Discord platform.
- YouTube Data API will be used to fetch music from YouTube.
- Spotify Web API will be used to access music from Spotify.
- SoundCloud API will be integrated to stream music from SoundCloud.

## Packages and Libraries:
- Discord.js (v13.1.0) - for creating the Discord bot and handling interactions.
- ytdl-core (v4.3.2) - for downloading and streaming YouTube music.
- spotify-web-api-node (v5.0.0) - for accessing Spotify music and playlists.
- soundcloud-music-api (v2.0.1) - for streaming music from SoundCloud.
- lyrics-finder (v3.1.0) - for fetching lyrics of songs.
- discord-player (v3.2.0) - for playing music in voice channels.
- node-fetch (v3.0.0) - for making HTTP requests to music APIs.

## Rationale:
- Node.js is chosen for its asynchronous and event-driven nature, making it ideal for handling the real-time interactions required in a Discord bot.
- JavaScript is a widely used language, and Discord.js is a popular library for creating Discord bots, providing extensive documentation and community support.
- YouTube Data API, Spotify Web API, and SoundCloud API are selected to provide a wide range of music sources for users.
- The specified packages and libraries are well-maintained, actively developed, and have the necessary functionalities required for music playback and interaction with music APIs.

By utilizing these technologies, APIs, and packages, the Discord bot will be able to deliver a robust music playback experience with various features and integrations for enhanced user engagement and enjoyment.
